    <h3>Steps:</h3>

            <li>Season both sides of the chicken breast with Italian seasoning and a pinch of salt</li>

            <li>Remove the chicken toa clean plate and turn the heat under the skillet down to medium-low</li>\
            <li>Add the butter and minced garlic to the skillet. Stir and cook the garlic in the melted butter for about 2 minutes, dissolving the browned bits form the bottom of the skillet as you stir</li>

            <li>Once the cream is simmering, add th grated Parmesan to the skillet. Continue to whisk ans tir until the Parmesan has melted into the sauce and the sauce has begun to simmer. Simmer the sauce for a few minutes, oor until it becomes slightly thicker. Add salt and pepper to the sauce to taste.</li>
            <li> Add the drained pasta to the skillet with the creamy sauce and toss to combine. If the sauce becomes too thick, add a couple of tablespoons fo the reserved pasta water and toss to combine with the sauce</li>
