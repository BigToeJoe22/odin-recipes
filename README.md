# odin-recipes
This project is all about making a recipe website. I'll demonstrate how to create and use various aspects of a HTML document including links to other recipes, logging progress into Git, and creating a cohesive webpage with several connected webpages

Some minor issues I ran into included remembering the right attributes to apply. I would get them mixed between images and links when trying to incorporate them onto the html document.
